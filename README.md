***WORK IN PROGRESS***

As of right now, I only have the uploads for my portfolio and one of my projects. 

I am working on getting my previous projects from high school to work on github with the stylesheet. 

*********************************************************************************************************

Welcome to my GitHub :)

My name is Giulia Martins and I am an undergraduate student from the University of South Florida.
I am currently majoring in Computer Science and wanting to pursue a career in Full Stack Development. 
I am currently more aware of front-end applications and in the progress of learning more back-end to 
have some knowledge ready for my internships, and hopefully, my future career. 

Please enjoy scrolling and downloading my files to view my project(s) and/or portfolio :)

***INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO OPEN THE ZIP FILES***

Once you click on one the zip files it would lead you to the next page. It would show a link called "view
raw," once you click that link, the zip file will be downloaded. 

When you click on the file for the folder, you can view any of the HTML files that are in the folder. (I
would recommend clicking the ones that say index.html since it is the first webpage page :) but if there 
is only one HTML file, just click on that :))

Enjoy!!
